## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for the project was the need to connect the suppliers of related products and services to consumers who could benefit from those services.

- The project was built to market the benefits of Search Engine Optimization to a target market, and also lay out the products and services that HORISEON provides, displaying problem and solution together to communicate value.  
- What problem does it solve?

- During this project, I learned many new things, including:
    -How to create github repositories and initialize them with my local machine.
    --Learned about putting the theories of git/github into practice.  
	Creating and initializing repositories,staging commits, pushing to repository,
	etc, to have functional version control.

	-Learned about semantic HTML elements, structuring the file logically. etc.

	-Played around with making changes to the HTML file to adjust the structure
	of the webpage, and the CSS file to adjust the style of the webpage.

	-Assessed the purpose of the webpage, made bonus changes to stlying sheets to
	draw more attention to the name of the company, and how it ties in with their
	products and services. (Adjusted color of "SEO" in the main header to be darker
	and bring out the contrast, drawing more attention to the acronym.
	The original wasn't different enough to easily draw the users attention to that
	feature of the website.
